# Epilleptic-Seizure-Recognition
This project has been done for the pattern recognition course supervised by [B. John Oommen](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~oommen/). Where Two traditional classifiers (quadratic, KNN) and two linear classifiers (Ho-Kashyap, Fisher discriminant) classifier have been used to create a pattern recognition system that can recognize an epileptic seizure. Also, non-parametric estimation parzen window estimation has been used just for training. For the quadratic classifier, two estimations have been used Bayesian and maximum likelihood.
